1.	In this repository, I decided to explore some futures of the dataset like: color, stock availability, brand, price and return policy, using pandas lib from Python.
2.	I started my exploration with the color feature, and I found that there are 547 colors available, and which are the 4 most dominant colors, also the brand name associated with the color.
3.	After that, I explore stock availability and the most dominant brands regarding availability.
4.	The most common brands and the no of the brands I found with pandas.
5.	Average price of each distinct brand, and top 10 brands with highest average price.
6.	Also regarding the return policy, there is no return policy.
